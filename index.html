	<h2>VISUALIZE BEYOND LENSES</h2>
	<P>Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure or power, but a quest for meaning. Frankl from “Man’s Search For Meaning” saw three possible sources for meaning; in work(doing something significant), in love(caring for another), and in courage during difficult times. We all ought to have something that we live for as lack of something to live for simply means lack of meaning and purpose of life. Having a “why” enables people to bear the “how”.

Suffering is meaningless and we give it meaning by the way we respond to it. Forces beyond control can take away everything except your freedom to choose how to respond to it. We are never left with nothing as long as we have freedom to choose.

	<h2>YOUTH NAVIGATION</h2>
	<P>Being a youth at this critical time isn’t easy by any means. With schools, friends, extracurricular activities and gatherings all coming to a standstill, it’s difficult navigating youthfulness. Recently, top off their struggles with a global pandemic, is a complete transformation of their lives and a whole new set of challenges they must navigate through has emerged ahead of them.

It’s no longer news that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought about increased feelings of uncertainty, loneliness and overall tension among all of us. To learn from social media solidarity over the climate crisis, where movements sparked worldwide to support the cause and show young peoples’ resilience. Even though lockdown restrictions are increasingly eased, the same cannot be said for the pressures facing youth mental health services.This is when it is key to take heart in resilience as a community, and an opportunity to use social media as a tool for community therapy and communication with each other on a positive note of solidarity – as opposed to one of panic. 

Making sure the youth keep to some semblance of a routine is key to managing healthy habits now that staying social, a youth’s normalcy has been disrupted. Encouraging enjoyment in things that may not have always been possible in a busy schedule can also be a healthy outlet to keep a sense of stability.

	<h2>INHERITED WESTERN CULTURE</h2>
	<P>The whole world has been changed and redesigned in all ways to accommodate western culture. Meanwhile cultural groups and traditional lifestyles persist to struggle in this new western world. However, the foreign culture offers comfortable living to some. It is a known fact that with every good there's a negative implication. So the said Western culture has come with their drawbacks all clashing with our African norms. Patriarchal supremacy has been the new normal in our homes. We have all been victims of this and have suffered from it's implications time and again. Not so far from this, European supremacy has ruled over us and that's why we find our African leaders giving way to their leadership positions in big companies that have turned around all our values. We have been blinded with the belief that whites are the only ones to rule and not ourselves.

	<h2>CONFIDENCE JOURNEY</h2>
	<P>I’ve never been the social type, hell, when I was young I didn’t feel confident enough to speak to my cousins (and we’re a really close family). I thought that me being younger than them meant there was nothing I could bring to the conversation.When we were at gatherings, my mum would start talking to other groups of people, and then she would introduce me to them, there were some people that I connected with, but most of the times I struggled to hold conversations.When we were at parties, she would start talking to other groups of people, and then she would introduce me to them, there were some people that I connected with, but most of the times I struggled to hold conversations.Overcoming my confidence issues wasn’t easy, I had to dig deep into myself and work my way out, getting rid of the negative thoughts and replacing them with positive ones, often facing hard truths about oneself. I worked hard to change what I didn’t like about myself, and what couldn’t be changed I accepted and embraced over time.
</P>
